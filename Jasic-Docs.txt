----- JASIC 1.0 DOCS -----


Welcome to JASIC, the cringe child of Java and BASIC!

JASIC is basically Java but with BASIC-like syntax.

It is "transpiled" to Java using a find-and-replace Python
program, because i don't know how to write a proper lexer and
parser yet.

--Syntax Changes--

Curly brackets "{,}" are replaced with the keywords "BEGIN" 
and "END". 

"System.out.print(ln)" is now simply PRINT or PRINTLN.

A shortcut for "public static void main(String[]args)", one
can use "MAIN METHOD" instead.

Classes are public by default. Simply type "CLASS" to make a 
class. Classees can also be private or protected, but you
must specify.

If statements work like this:

	IF (condition) THEN
		[code here]
	END
	ELSE BEGIN
		[code here]
	END

Notice how the bracket is replaced with a "THEN".

"Boolean" is shortened to "BOOL".

For loops work like this:

	FOR(variable,start,end,step) BEGIN
		[code here]
	END

Comments are always multi line comments, they are done like
this:

REM this is a comment STOP

or 

REM
this
is 
a 
comment
STOP

All other Java keywords are the same, just capitalized.

Semicolons must be added at the end of a statement the same as
it is in Java. This will be fixed later.

-----Known Issues----

Can't use keywords in strings or comments else they will be
replaced. This will be fixed later.

For example, don't go 
	PRINT("I am PRINT-ing!");
Instead for now, try 
	PRINT("I am print-ing"!);
JASIC keywords are case-sensitive.
