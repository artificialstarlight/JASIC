# JASIC
A WIP language, Java with BASIC-like syntax. "Transpiled" to Java.

Update 1/21/2024: I literally made this like 6 years ago in high school in order to get out of doing my java homework. please don't use this for anything lol


# Rules of JASIC
So far, here are the changes.
Check the jasic-docs.txt

# The Python program
run in cmd "python jasic.py infile.jsc outfile.java"
it will convert the .jsc into a valid Java file with Java syntax!
