# JASIC
A WIP language, Java with BASIC-like syntax. "Transpiled" to Java.


# Rules of JASIC
So far, here are the changes.

PRINT("hi"); --> prints the string "hi" to a new line

BEGIN ---> Eqivalent of "{"

END ----> Equivalent of "}"

FOR(var,start,end,step) ---> a for loop

Everything else is basically just Java.


# The Python program
run in cmd "python jasic.py infile.jsc"
it will convert the .jsc into a valid Java file with Java syntax!
